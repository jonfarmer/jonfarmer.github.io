      <h2>who am i?</h2>
      <p>I'm a Connecticut native living in New York with a passion for filmmaking and front end engineering. I'm currently studying HTML, CSS, Javascript, and plan to add Python to that list soon. I also have an interest in projects based around mini-computers and microcontrollers. </p>
      <p>I enjoy problem-solving and I get a lot of fulfillment out of collaborating with team members. My learning style is kinesthetic, so I'm always eager to get my hands dirty and learn as I go. Feedback is crucial to me. With the right lens, every mistake is an opportunity to grow.</p>
      <p>Emerging technologies, specifically related to blockchains, are especially interesting to me. I am eager to learn about and contribute to projects that have the power to change our society as we know it.</p>
